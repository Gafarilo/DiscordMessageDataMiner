## DiscordMessageDataMiner\n\nThis bot, once configured, collects every posted message from the Discord server it is added to.\n\nMessages are logged into a folder ./dump/ named as {channel-name}-dump.txt. \n\n### Building\n\nTo build, CD into the folder and execute:\n\n make build\n\n### Running\n\nFor running this bot, a config.toml file with your bot API token is required. A sample has been provided for help, just replace discordToken with your token.\n\nThe bot will look for a file named config.toml by default. However, a specific path can be specified using -c /path/to/config.toml. This repository is now maintained by Gafarilo.
